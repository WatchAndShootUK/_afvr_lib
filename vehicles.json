Interestingly all of the parts were produced indigenously in Yugoslavia, leaving no reliance on imported parts. The M-84A forms the backbone of the Serbian mechanised brigades.",

There is a cylinder behind the gun, which is the meteorological sensor for the fire control computer, the large DNNS-2 gunners day/night sight in front of the gunners hatch and the lack of an IR searchlight. The gunners sight is different to that of a T-72 due to it being larger, but also the fact it doesn't have the typical T-72 'doghouse' TPD-K1 sight. I recommend you use the compare feature between this and the T-72A to understand the differences between the two."

It is optimised to target the U.S. HF Global Communications System (HFGCS). It is designed to interfere with tactical, operational and strategic communications. Each Murmansk-BN antenna group consists of four 105 ft (32 m) telescopic masts that are interlinked to create a single, large array. The arrays are controlled by Kamaz trucks, it takes several days to set up, once set up the Murmansk-BN has a range of upto 5000km, in theory it could essentially ‘cover’ the whole of europe. It has been deployed in Kaliningrad, near the Finnish border and also the Crimea.\r\n",

The vehicles are used by Russian Army units in extreme climates, as well as civilian companies who use them for logging in the Far East and also scientific companies who conduct scientific research in extreme climates like the Arctic as well as remote and isolated regions like the Northern Islands of Russia. Some vehicles were used in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mostly by the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade. This and the DT-30 series are commonly confused, it is key to remember that the DT-30 is larger and longer than the DT-10. More than a hundred Vityaz vehicles are used in Russia for the transportation of cargo, such as: blocks, cranes and even towers for power lines in hard to reach regions.

Continued delays in China's third generation MBT development meant the PLA had no choice but to continue development of the ZTZ-85 family, leading to it becoming the ZTZ-96. The design was aided when China obtained a T-72 from Romania. The ZTZ-96 was the first Chinese tank to be fitted with a 125mm main armament, it also boasted modern features like composite armour and a welded turret. Today, along with it's upgraded variants (ZTZ-96A/B) forms the backbone of the PLA's combined arms battalions in the heavy combined arms brigades. Despite all the upgrades, the tank is still relatively underpowered when compared to NATO and Soviet tanks from the same era.",

One of the most significant parts of BVM upgrade is Sosna-U, however these tanks have instead 1PN96MT-02 2nd gen thermal sight.  The T-80BV Obr.2022g also retains 1G42 gunner's sight (T-80BVM has PDT next to Sosna-U). This indicates these tanks were actually made from T-80BV. Hopefully this saves the confusion.

It’s light weight, powerful engine combine it for use in places the ZTZ-99 MBT would have problems. Protection is a steel composite, it also has an ERA and bar armour package seen in photos and on Chinese state media. Other equipment includes air conditioning system, oxygen-production equipment for the crew, command and control equipment, battlefield management system, and navigation suite fitted with both inertial navigation system (INS) and satellite navigation system. Due to its lighter weight, the ZTQ-15 tank can be more easily airlifted. Y-20 transport planes can only carry one ZTZ-99 tank but can carry up to two ZTQ-15 tanks and achieve long-range deployment of 7,800 kilometers. ZTQ-15 can also be paradropped by the transport aircraft. It is lightly armed, but this is purely because it will be unlikely to encounter MBT's in it's perceived AO's.",

Operating as an observation post and a light Fire Support Team Vehicle (FISTV), it plays a crucial role as a forward observer. Its arsenal includes a long-range data-capable computer and three medium-range radios, initially featuring a radio teletype which was replaced by a computer. It boasts impressive observation capabilities with enhanced day and night vision, a laser rangefinder, and a laser designator, all housed in an expanded turret. Armed with a light machine gun, the vehicle can also perform secondary functions like surveying gun locations. A telescoping antenna ensures long-range communication, while GLONASS navigation with an inertial backup aids movement. Upgraded versions sport improved day and night vision, making the 1V14 an invaluable asset for relaying sensor data, target coordinates, and preliminary fire solutions to higher headquarters.",

The Rooikat 1C at the present is mainly in storage, with the Rooikat 1D being the latest version in active service. The Rooikat is perfect for the biome it operates in, the Southern African battlespace is an unforgiving environment, and in terms of armoured warfare, mobility is the key there, hence why the Rooikat is focused on mobility. The vehicle can outmanoeuvre tanks and destroy them in these conditions, where armoured engagements are generally at close range.

This modification is both of Russian and Transnistrian design, the Operational Group of Russian Forces (OGRF) is the Russian peacekeeping unit based in Cobasna, unrecognised Transnistria, since the Ukrainian banning of Russian arms movements through its country in 2014, the OGRF is left with an old mix of out of service equipment unlike the rest of the Russian Armed Forces for example BTR-60's, BRDM-2's, so modifications like these are commonplace nowadays. The modification itself is an MTLB with a modified BTR-70 turret on a tower, it was confirmed in an interview with an OGRF officer that it is for air defence. It is likely that due to the block on weapons, Transnistria and the OGRF will continue to display interesting modifications unlike any other country in Europe.",

The engine and transmission remains the same as the T-72B which is the V-12 V-84MS engine, so it is lacking in power compared to a T-72B3 or T90A. The T-72BM2 has been accepted for service, but it is currently unknown if the armed forces have received it yet (as of October 2022), so I hope you understand there aren't many images around yet, any new images will be added when they're available.",

It has a heavy focus on ship-borne amphibious operations; it is statistically improved in every way when compared to the contemporary USMC AAV-7A1. It would appear that the creators of the Type-05 took a large amount of inspiration from the USMC’s EFV (Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle), which would have fulfilled the same capability role as the Type-05 does. It has 2 variants, the ZBD-05 which is this one, the IFV, then the Type-05 Assault Vehicle, which is also covered here. The key difference between the 2 vehicles are the turrets, the ZBD-05 having the Ukrainian 30mm Shkval module, with the ZTD-05 AV having an upgraded L7 105mm gun. An interesting feature of the ZBD-05 platform is that when in the water, the engine is able to generate 1475 horsepower as well as switching to land mode with only 550 horsepower.",

The turret is a small 2 man turret towards the rear, with a slightly sloped front, with flat sides. The driver is seated on the front left, with a raised cupola. A great recognising feature with the Type 05 IFV is that PLANMC are vehicles are typically painted in a camouflage design with a heavy blue/light blue colouration, this will be a good recognising feature.",

It features a two-wheel split trail carriage, and its 152mm 47-caliber armament includes a double baffle muzzle brake and sliding breech block. Operated by an eight-member crew with a gun shield for protection, the 2A65 can fire up to 28.5 km with specialised ammunition at 7 rounds per minute. Its mobility requires a 6x6 5-ton truck, like the Ural-4320 or KamAZ-6530.

It has a KMT-5M mine clearing system, but this isn’t always the case, some are seen with the KMT-7 and KMT-9 mine rollers, it also has a modified machine gun turret from a BTR-60.\nThe vehicle itself is extremely rare, most of the pictures I could find where of a singular Ukrainian vehicle from 2014 which is in a poor condition, likely stored since 1991.",

They can also be used as recovery vehicles due to the high pull ratio, they also have a very low ground pressure, which is useful for preventing the detonation of mines. The vehicles are used by Russian Army units in extreme climates, as well as civilian companies who use them for logging in the Far East and also scientific companies who conduct scientific research in extreme climates like the Arctic as well as remote and isolated regions like the Northern Islands of Russia. Some vehicles were used in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mostly by the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade. This and the DT-10 series are commonly confused, it is key to remember that the DT-30 is larger and longer than the DT-10. More than a hundred Vityaz vehicles are used in Russia for the transportation of cargo, such as: blocks, cranes and even towers for power lines in hard to reach regions. They serve rescue teams in extreme conditions. When a natural disaster occurs, there are no roads, the Vityaz all-terrain vehicle is a great help.",

It is for this reason that the Krasukha-2 protects complexes like command posts, air defence systems, industrial complexes in a time of war, the system assesses the kind of signal and provides impact on that radar signal with powerful jamming radiation, the result of this is that the aircraft being jammed are halted in an attempt of detecting targets, depriving them of being able to launch radar guided missiles. Krasukha-2 can also interfere with hypersonic aircraft, this means the Krasukha-2 is a cheap way of covering important and sensitive sites, without having to deploy valuable air defence systems. It has been used in Syria, as well as in 2018 in Eastern Ukraine, one system was captured by Ukrainian forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.",

Designed to target enemy forces and equipment, it's adept for counter-battery actions and operates effectively in temperatures from -50°C to 50°C. This gun is the towed counterpart of the 2S5 Giatsint-S. It's utilized by nations like Russia, Finland, Iraq, Ukraine, and Lebanon, notably during Lebanon's Nahr el-Bared conflict, possibly acquired from Iraq before the Lebanese Civil War ended. The 2A36 features a semi-automatic breech, a hydro-pneumatic battery harnessing recoil energy, and a chain-driven rammer. Its hydraulic-powered carriage offers a two-speed elevation mechanism.",

Whereas the BMP-1 has the 9M14 fitted above the gun as a bare missile, the BMP-1P now has an 9M113 on the top right of the turret. Although this may seem intricate and unnecessary to learn, the change in ATGM hugely changes the potency of this IFV, for example the effective range of the 9M14 compared to the 9M113 is as follows, 9M14-3km, 9M113-4km.

Its army trials were long and drawn out, beginning in 1998 and only entering service in 2021, with the 90th Guards Tank Brigade, in Boguchar, part of the Central Military District. It is heavily armed and armoured, the guns are fed different ammunition, for example one 30mm is loaded with HEI-T and one with APDS. The turret is unmanned with all the crew sat in the hull. It first saw service in Eastern Ukraine in May, 2022.",

It's an affordable version of the advanced 2S31 Vena, as it repurposes existing vehicles without APS. The 2S34 retains the hull, engine, and drivetrain from the 2S1 but swaps its 122mm 2A31 howitzer for a 120mm 2A80-1 gun/mortar with a distinct square muzzle brake. This gun/mortar is aided by a semi-automatic loader, enhancing the loading speed at high elevations. It offers comparable firepower to the 2S31 Vena, supporting various shells and direct fire capabilities. The 2S34 has armoured protection, an NBC system, and newly added smoke grenade dischargers. Its 300 hp diesel engine maintains mobility in challenging terrains and allows amphibious capabilities. Russia, its sole user, has a limited number of 2S34s, despite its potential advantages.",

The T-80BV is famous for the myth of its poor performance in Chechnya, records of T-80 and T-72 losses barely differ, it was just due to the embarrassment that it was blamed, the Russian Army failed to blame the poor crew training and corruption, a lot of tanks went in to Grozny with no ERA due to the plastic explosive being sold off by crews.",

It was designed to operate in extreme climatic biomes like northern Russia, Siberia and the Far East. They can also be used as recovery vehicles due to the high pull ratio, they also have a very low ground pressure, which is useful for preventing the detonation of mines. The vehicles are used by Russian Army units in extreme climates, as well as civilian companies who conduct scientific research in extreme climates like the Arctic as well as remote and isolated regions like the Northern Islands of Russia. Some vehicles were used in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mostly by the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade. More than a hundred Vityaz vehicles are used in Russia for the transportation of cargo, such as: blocks, cranes and even towers for power lines in hard to reach regions. They serve rescue teams in extreme conditions. When a natural disaster occurs, there are no roads, the Vityaz all-terrain vehicle is a great help.",

The Warrior was first delivered to 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards in 1987, with a total of 789 Warriors produced. The Warrior was produced with British armoured infantry doctrine in mind, this being that the IFV drives the infantry section up to the position under armour, the section then dismounts and attacks the position with fire support from the vehicle, none of this lazy infantry stuff like firing ports.

However, this acquisition did not include Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs) or Self-Propelled Guns (SPGs). Instead, Transnistria ended up with a collection of unique and specialized engineering vehicles that are rarely found in the arsenals of other countries worldwide. Consequently, the region had to make interesting modifications to compensate for the lack of IFVs and Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs).\n\nOne of these modifications is the BTRG-127, which was transformed from a GMZ-3 minelayer into an APC. The minelaying equipment was removed, and benches were installed inside along with a rear door. Additionally, a turret was added, accommodating a 12.7mm Heavy Machine Gun (HMG). Due to restrictions on weapons, it is likely that Transnistria, along with the Operational Group of Russian Forces (OGRF), will continue to showcase intriguing modifications that are unparalleled in any other European country.",

They can also be used as recovery vehicles due to the high pull ratio, they also have a very low ground pressure, which is useful for preventing the detonation of mines. The vehicles are used by Russian Army units in extreme climates, as well as civilian companies who use them for logging in the Far East and also scientific companies who conduct scientific research in extreme climates like the Arctic as well as remote and isolated regions like the Northern Islands of Russia. Some vehicles were used in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mostly by the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade. This and the DT-30 series are commonly confused, it is key to remember that the DT-30 is larger and longer than the DT-10. More than a hundred Vityaz vehicles are used in Russia for the transportation of cargo, such as: blocks, cranes and even towers for power lines in hard to reach regions. They serve rescue teams in extreme conditions. When a natural disaster occurs, there are no roads, the Vityaz all-terrain vehicle is a great help.",

The turret is the same and is recognisable by it's large boxy shape, sloped front and dual cannons, as well as this it's relatively common to see the turret still painted in naval grey colours, despite this one being green, its relatively rare to see them painted this way."

Incorporating elements from the T-62, T-72M and T-80BV, it features a 125mm hand-loaded cannon, a KPVT and a coaxial PKT. The Songun Ho features ERA of an unknown type on the hull and turret front.\r\nThe  Songun Ho 915 is the first production model from the DPRK to feature a 125mm cannon. Featuring an improved T-72 style engine deck, soft kill APS with LWS and automated smoke systems. Examples have been seen with a single MANPAD, mounted on a stick mount but that is believed to be a parade mounting to show the missile, and that crews carry one for dismounted to protect the tank. The name comes from Songun, which is the \"military-first\" policy of North Korea, prioritizing the Korean People's Army in the affairs of state and allocation of resources.",

The 100mm D-10T was replaced with an Iranian produced 105mm based on the Royal Ordnance L7, it therefore is capable of firing NATO 105mm munitions. It also has upgrades consisting of a fire control system, dual-plane gun stabilisation, laser rangefinder, 2nd gen night sights, ERA and a V46-6 engine, which hugely improves mobility. ",

It features the same water jets found upon the normal 323s. It combines the virtues of a light MLRS and an APC. Its KPVT is capable of significant elevation as part of the KPA doctrine emphasizing all arms air defence.\r\nIts common name, Sonyon means child as the first examples presented in 1979 were done by several children's organizations. Its rocket launcher is a derivation of the Type-63, featuring 18 tubes instead of the normal 12. The mounting on this model is a turn table capable of 360 degrees of traverse, compared to the fixed forward mountings seen on early models. Unlike the later 1997 models it does not carry a reload and needs to rearm its rockets after each engagement.",

These are a widespread model of SPAAG within the KPA, seen prominently in several parades, notably in 1985 and 1992 before disappearing from the public eye along with most SPAAGs during the Arduous March, hence the lack of images.  It is limited to daylight operations as it lacks a radar and likely has only marginal capabilities against fixed wing aircraft given its short ranged, slow firing armament, but its twin 37mm autocannons are still significant threats to helicopters, light vehicles and infantry.

      "description": "The M1983 Tok'chon, is armed with a variant of the T-12 100mm cannon, they are used in both AT units or as substitutes for T-68 Medium Tanks in armoured units. Based upon the ATS-59G chassis the Tok'chon 100 is a capable AT unit and within its magazine carries at least 2 Manpads for self defence against aircraft. It has no mounted machine gun and thus lacks some defence against infantry at close range. It possesses similar mobility to the T-55 but handles terrain better due to its lighter weight. Armor protection is unknown but it is believed to be frontally protected from 20mm autocannons and small arms from the sides and rear. Unlike most Tok'chons it does not require the crew to dismount to operate, though it does retain their lack of overhead protection. It can be utilized in indirect fire but is primarily seen in AT units.",

The parts that are different are generally the armament and turret/gun shield, for the M1983 it is clearly identifiable as a direct role engagement platform by the lack of a muzzle brake on the 100mm T-12 gun and also that the guns resting position is level, whereas on most of the artillery vehicles they rest in a raised position.
